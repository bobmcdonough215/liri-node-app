#Purpose
The purpose of this project was to make a Node.js app that depends on user input from the command line. The user would open Ternminal and input node, file name, the command, and a random movie, artist, song, or "do-what-it-says" in the .txt file. This would use API calls and parse through returned JSON objects, outputting them in a specified format.
